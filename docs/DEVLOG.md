### 2026-02-01 — Phase 0: Repo setup, hygiene, and reproducibility
- Initialized a reproducible project scaffold (src/, tests/, docs/, data/) and verified baseline tests.
- Enforced repo hygiene: excluded local-only tooling and non-shareable files from version control.
- Created and published the GitHub repository with a clean main branch history.

Validation:
- pytest -q passes
- main branch contains only intended tracked artifacts
- confirmed push to GitHub (main tracking origin/main)
