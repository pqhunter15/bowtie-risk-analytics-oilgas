      "summary": "On May 2, 2024, during 5-year recertification load testing of forward starboard knuckle boom crane (KBC #1) on the drillship Noble Stanley Lafosse at GC 478, a winch brake assembly failure occurred at approximately 70 MT while attempting to reach 93.5 MT test load. The crane's Automatic Overload Protection System (AOPS) activated, but brake assembly #4 failed to release simultaneously with the other three brakes. This caused excessive load on the sprag clutches which sheared, resulting in uncontrolled descent of the water bag. The descent caused a hydraulic test port failure, spraying hydraulic fluid on deck (LOPC). The water bag contacted the take-on station, ripped open, and descended to the Gulf of Mexico. Two hydraulic motors and four brake assemblies were damaged. Total property damage was $168,150. No injuries occurred.",

While attempting to correct an abnormal twist in a 2-inch diameter drill line using an air tugger and nylon web sling, the drill line slipped from the sling and fell approximately 20-25 feet. The 19-foot section weighing 148 pounds struck the employee who had tripped while exiting the line of fire, hitting his hardhat, rolling over his middle back and left shoulder. He was diagnosed with a torn labrum and required 10-12 weeks of physical therapy.",

The driller lost situational awareness while checking the pipe tally, and the crown-o-matic (COM) failed to trip when contacted by the drill line because the barrel wasn't set properly. Contributing factors included inadequate hazard analysis in the JSA, lack of rig-specific procedures for checking the COM, and failure of floorhand to count tool joints during the operation.",

      "summary": "On November 10, 2024, at 0145 hours, an injured person (IP) was struck by a wave on the stern of the Transocean Deepwater Invictus drillship during workover operations. Despite being informed during a pre-tour meeting that the stern was secured due to deteriorating weather and building seas (approximately 15-foot waves), the IP entered the restricted area to observe the water. A wave struck the IP, throwing him approximately 20 feet across the rig, causing him to strike a bollard before coming to rest at the base of a stairwell. The IP sustained a fractured right femur and was evacuated to West Jefferson Hospital. The investigation concluded that the IP's failure to observe the secured area and follow supervisor direction contributed significantly to the accident.",

      "summary": "On July 11, 2024, at approximately 0730 hours, during a routine life capsule inspection at the High Island A-5 Manta Ray Gathering Facility, a contract pipeline operator from Quality Process Services suffered a serious head injury when struck by a winch assist handle. The Genesis Person in Charge and the injured person lowered the capsule 4 to 6 feet to verify winch operations. After lowering, the PIC engaged the electric winch from the lower section to raise the capsule. The winch assist handle, which should have been removed before operating the electric winch, remained in the socket. As the winch operated, the handle struck the IP in the head, causing him to fall unconscious with head bleeding. A safety device designed to prevent winch operation with the handle in place had been bypassed. The IP was diagnosed with a fractured skull requiring surgery. The incident was attributed to inadequate knowledge of equipment operation and failure to follow safety protocols, with contributing factors including lack of Job Safety Analysis and improper equipment handling.",

      "summary": "On March 13, 2024, during plug and abandon operations on jack-up rig Enterprise 264, a crane stinger failed while offloading a 4x40 foot basket weighing 13,000 pounds from a workboat. The stinger, rated for 9.80 tons vertical pull, parted due to internal corrosion from moisture buildup in the socket over time. The basket fell upside down onto the control room, P-tanks, and platform on top of living quarters, causing approximately $7,500 in damage. No injuries occurred. Investigation revealed that the stinger had not been specifically inspected prior to use, and inspection procedures (Preventive Maintenance Daily checklist, cold work permit, and JSA) did not explicitly require stinger inspection.",

The IP had turned his back to the suspended load while verifying casing tally and failed to recognize he was positioned in the impact zone between the casing bundle and a sub-rack basket. Despite warnings from riggers, the bundle struck the IP on the right hip, forcing his left hip into the sub-rack basket, resulting in three pelvic fractures. The IP was evacuated to hospital and discharged four days later.",

When the slips were opened to install anti-rotation keys, 72 joints of casing fell partially into the hole and onto the seafloor, impacting subsea infrastructure. The connection was made up only 1/4 to 3/8 turn instead of the required 1/2 to 3/4 turn, and visual inspection failed to detect a 0.143 inch gap indicating cross-threading.

      "summary": "On February 18, 2023, at 21:27 hours, while pulling out of the hole with the 13th stand of 4-1/2 inch drill pipe on the Thunder Horse PDQ Platform, the Driller opened the BX4 elevator before the Pipe Racking System (PRS) could secure the stand. This caused the stand of drill pipe to fall across the rig floor towards the port side, landing on the auxiliary PRS hoist. Three Floor Hands in the yellow zone evacuated the area, with one slipping on the deck and injuring his knee and hip. The Floor Hand was evacuated the next day for medical evaluation. The incident could have resulted in multiple fatalities. Investigation revealed the Driller had a similar incident on January 3, 2023, and was not following Work Instructions WI-TH-DR-OPS-096.",

      "summary": "On June 18, 2023, at approximately 18:35, an amputation injury occurred during decommissioning operations at Platform Gail. The injured person was adjusting chains in a marine growth removal system when a conductor began rising unexpectedly. The injured person had requested an 'all stop' and seeing movement stop, placed his left hand fingers under the chain just as the conductor began rising again. This motion caused the chain to tighten, trapping the injured person's left hand and amputating the tips of two fingers (middle and ring finger between fingernail and first knuckle). The incident occurred because the 'all stop' call was not confirmed by the casing jack operator, who was simultaneously checking the conductor's weight. The injured person mistook the brief pause for a confirmed stop and proceeded with chain adjustment.",

The injured person was using his hands to guide the crane block instead of push poles as required by company policy. The incident occurred during a blind lift operation where the crane operator could not see the load due to the lift boat being jacked up above the platform deck level.",

      "summary": "On January 5, 2023, at 1730 hours, a fire occurred at High Island 547 B platform involving the Glycol Reboiler Dehydration system. The still column vent pipe became plugged, resulting in pressure build up until it ruptured. The rupture caused glycol to spray which contacted the reboiler and exhaust stack (operating at 750-800°F), igniting the glycol mixture. Platform operators activated emergency shutdown and extinguished the fire in ten minutes using fire extinguishers. No injuries or pollution occurred. Fire damage was limited to the Glycol Reboiler and Dehydration unit, totaling over $100,000.",

      "summary": "On January 3, 2023, at 2210 hours, a DC capacitor on Universal Power Supply UPS-7560 failed at the Perdido Spar platform, causing smoke release, arcing/sparking, and activation of smoke detectors. The automated safety system shut-in the facility and caused full power loss. The Fire Team responded but found no visible fire. The Electrical Team isolated power feeds and identified the failed inverter through troubleshooting. The UPS was locked out and bypassed, with a spare circuit providing power. Estimated repair cost is $56,830 with 7-9 weeks lead time for parts. No injuries or pollution occurred.",

      "summary": "On March 21, 2023, at 02:30 hours, a 25-pound riser bolt insert dislodged from a riser flange and fell approximately 75 feet to the rig floor on the drillship Valaris DS-18. The insert passed between two Floorhands and struck an aluminum stairway, damaging two steps. The drill crew was running marine riser joint #36 using the Top Drive when the incident occurred. Investigation revealed that the riser retainer pin was either never installed or fell out during transport, and the required retention cable (sling) was not installed as specified in Step 6, Item 'd' of the WIMS. Personnel failed to stop work immediately after the incident and continued making up riser bolts for several minutes before reporting.",

The injured person (IP) was assisting the wireline helper disconnect wireline tools when his right hand was caught between the upper C-plate with tools weighing 175 lbs and lower C-plate. The helper had raised the tool string approximately 4 inches above the bottom C-plate. The IP placed his right hand under the upper C-plate to stabilize the tool string. When the helper released the tools, they fell 4 inches, smashing the IP's right hand between the C-plates, causing lacerations to the right hand ring and middle fingertips and a broken finger tip. The IP required evacuation and 14 stitches. Investigation revealed the helper lacked deepwater experience, the IP was not properly trained on wireline tools, the JSEA was inadequate, communication was poor, and Stop Work Authority was not used.",

      "summary": "On March 28, 2024, the Transocean Subsea Superintendent fell approximately nine feet through an open hole on a BOP work platform on the drillship Transocean Deepwater Atlas. The hatch cover had been removed after its hinge separated, creating a dropped object hazard, but no barrier was installed and the open hole was not communicated to the work team. The IP was wearing a safety harness but was not tied off. He injured his knee and shin and was evacuated for medical treatment. The remote control box he was carrying fell an additional 40 feet. Investigation found failures in communication, hazard identification, and implementation of corrective actions.",

When the PIC instructed the crane operator to lower the boom without simultaneously lowering the main block (ignoring CO-2's warning), the stinger pulled free and broke a weld on the boom lace. Despite discovering the damage the next day during pre-use inspection, the PIC instructed crew to continue using the damaged crane. The crane remained in operation from May 31 until BSEE inspectors took it out of service on June 6, 2024. BSEE was not immediately notified of the incident as required.",

The IP positioned himself on the upper fingerboards, outside the designated safe observation area, without a working-at-heights permit to tie up a malfunctioning fingerboard latch. While working on the latch for approximately 10 minutes, the Pipe Racking System (PRS), operating in automatic mode, extended to retrieve a stand of pipe. The IP was caught and pinned between the PRS arm and the pipe stand. Coworkers heard his calls for help, the AD engaged the emergency stop, and the IP was freed and evacuated for medical treatment. The incident resulted from policy violations and lack of situational awareness by multiple parties.",

While attempting to steady a 50-foot basket with a tagline as it was being landed, the support vessel rolled causing the IP to lose footing and injure his left leg. The IP was evacuated to the drillship, then to shore, required surgery, and resulted in more than 3-days lost time.",

      "summary": "On December 8, 2023, at approximately 08:30 am, a Floorhand (IP) sustained a lost time injury when contacted by the Top Drive System (TDS) while positioned on the port pipe racker upper access platform approximately 80 feet above the drill floor on the Noble Globetrotter II drilling rig. The IP had moved to the platform to troubleshoot a 'slack rope detected' alarm without notifying the Driller. As the Driller lowered the TDS during tripping operations, the lower port TDS roller assembly contacted the IP, folding his upper torso around the outside handrail. The IP sustained a punctured lung, fractured ribs, and a fractured scapula. The incident resulted from inadequate communication, failure to identify the moving equipment hazard in the JSA, lack of warning signage, and absence of engineered barriers despite only 3 inches clearance between the TDS and platform handrail.",

      "summary": "On October 3, 2024, at approximately 9:00 am, an arc flash fire occurred on Shell's Perdido SPAR when a Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR) failed in the SCR house. During wireline logging operations, the cement pump was being used to pump base oil into well GA017 for hydrate mitigation when the cement unit's electronic panel lost power. When the Tool Pusher and Rig Electrician entered the SCR room to investigate, they heard a loud popping sound and observed smoke. Evidence of arcing between DC buss bars, arcing on circuit breaker heat sinks, and a failed buss insulator in SCR cabinet #1 was identified. The fire and gas alarm system did not detect the fire; it was only identified when personnel entered the SCR house. The well was secured and SCR cabinet #1 was isolated for repair.",

      "summary": "On September 4, 2023, approximately 24 barrels of Synthetic Based Mud (SBM) were discharged into the Gulf of Mexico from the H&P 205 drilling rig on Shell's Perdido Spar. The crew was circulating a clean out run and had transferred 117 bbls of SBM to processing pits to remove entrained gas. Seven minutes after the transfer pump was turned off, the degasser tank volume began decreasing. Investigation revealed that both the knife valve on the degasser tank discharge line and the butterfly valve (master dump valve) had leaked due to obstructions - cuttings in the knife valve and a piece of rubber in the butterfly valve - preventing proper sealing. The crew had visually verified valve positions per procedure but did not functionally test the valves prior to transfer. The valves had not been operated since April 2023.",

The B-phase reactor of the VFD-A failed to ground, releasing smoke that activated smoke detectors in the Subsea Motor Control Center room. This triggered an automated facility shut-in and personnel muster. The Fire Team responded but found no active fire, only smoke. Cabinet A reached 350°F and was isolated from service. Estimated damage cost was $65,000. No injuries or pollution occurred.",

The captain dozed off before impact. The vessel was traveling at cruising speed of 8 knots when the captain fell asleep. A production operator aboard the vessel reported back soreness and was transported to an onshore medical facility, later released to full duty (first aid case). The allision caused damage to several structural members. The platform was shut in and the damaged area barricaded. Engineering analysis determined the platform was safe to man with wave heights below 20 feet. Total repair costs remain unknown but not expected to exceed $25K.",

      "summary": "On June 9, 2009, a catastrophic natural gas explosion occurred at the ConAgra Slim Jim production facility in Garner, North Carolina, resulting in 4 deaths, 3 critical burn injuries, 1 amputation, and 67 total hospitalizations. The explosion occurred during installation and commissioning of a new 5-million BTU per hour gas-fired industrial water heater. Over a two-and-a-half hour period, natural gas was purged from new piping into an interior utility room rather than vented outdoors. Personnel relied on sense of smell rather than combustible gas detectors to monitor gas concentration. The gas accumulated to explosive levels and ignited, causing serious structural damage including 37% roof collapse. The explosion also damaged ammonia refrigeration system piping, releasing approximately 18,000 pounds of toxic anhydrous ammonia to the environment, contaminating local surface waters and causing a fish kill. Over 200 nonessential personnel were present in the facility during the purging activity.",
      "recommendations": [
        "Enact Tentative Interim Amendment and permanent changes to National Fuel Gas Code requiring purged fuel gases be directly vented to safe location outdoors away from personnel and ignition sources",

        "Require combustible gas detectors to continuously monitor gas concentration at appropriate locations where purged gases are released",
        "Require personnel training about odor fade and odor fatigue and warn against relying on odor alone for detecting fuel gas releases",

When the crane operator lifted the boom out of its rest after lunch break without conducting a pre-use inspection, one lever hoist broke and fell approximately 30 feet to the flare boom mezzanine deck. No injuries occurred. The incident resulted from communication failures, inadequate supervision, and simultaneous operations in a confined area.",

      "summary": "On May 25, 2023, at 1:15am, approximately 79 barrels of zinc bromide brine was inadvertently discharged from a wellhead casing valve at Well Number C007 on Platform C at East Cameron Block 71. During BOP testing operations, a Floorhand was assigned to close a 1 13/16-inch 10M gate valve on the wellhead casing. The Floorhand believed the valve was closed but it was not fully closed. When zinc bromide brine was pumped to refill the production casing and BOP, the partially open valve allowed fluid to discharge into the Gulf of Mexico. The Floorhand noticed slower than normal returns and was sent to recheck the valve, where he fully closed it and stopped the flow. Investigation using Pit Volume Totalizer data determined the actual release was 79 barrels, significantly more than the initially reported 28 barrels.",

      "summary": "On August 20, 2023, at approximately 1000 hours, the auxiliary jib on the platform crane detached while attempting to relocate a construction supply box weighing 3,886 lbs. The crane operator failed to center the auxiliary line over the construction supply box, causing it to become lodged on a capping beam. Continued lifting created a side loading effect that caused the boom to twist, shearing the auxiliary jib bolts and causing the jib to detach. The auxiliary jib became entangled in hydraulic lines, preventing it from falling to the deck. The rigger failed to communicate the all stop signal. No injuries occurred. Repairs totaled $80,000.",

      "summary": "On October 3, 2025, at approximately 1230 hours, a contract fitter sustained a severe injury to his right leg during decommissioning operations on the White Fleet Operating OCS-G00985 Eugene Island 259 C Facility. While attempting to install stabilizing brackets to support piping during platform removal operations, a section of 8-inch pipe was cut approximately 20 feet away from the CF. Once the section was cut, the remaining pipe shifted and slid towards the CF, pinning his right leg between a flange on the cut pipe and the piping the CF's leg was draped across. The CF suffered multiple fractures of the right femur. The incident was caused by inadequate job instructions and failure to communicate crew locations, and inadequate hazard analysis that failed to address potential pipe movement due to stored energy.",

      "summary": "On October 13, 2023, at approximately 1745 hours, a crane mechanic fell approximately 96 ft from the gantry of a crane into the water at Cox Operating's Eugene Island 259 C Facility. While attempting to replace the auxiliary winch, the crane mechanic positioned himself over the handrail without wearing a safety harness or life vest to remove a brace blocking the winch installation. When the second bolt broke, the brace detached and contacted the crane mechanic, causing him to fall over the handrails. He suffered a fractured rib, dislocated shoulder, and internal bleeding.",

      "summary": "On 17 March 2025 at 2140 hours, during well abandonment operations at Eugene Island Block 307A, a single joint of 3.5-inch pipe fell approximately 40 feet to the deck. The incident occurred when a crane operator, without clear line of sight, lowered the pipe onto a Self-Retracting Lifeline (SRL) Arm in an elevated hydraulic jack basket. When the floor hand pushed the pipe off the SRL arm, the impact caused worn elevator doors to open, releasing the pipe. Two workers in the area moved out of the way before the pipe struck a hydraulic hose and fire extinguisher handle. No injuries or pollution occurred; damages totaled $4,000.",

      "summary": "On 17 July 2025 at 0752 hours, during workover operations at Garden Banks Block 215, a 0.375-inch high-pressure hose ruptured while blowing down a coil tubing reel with nitrogen. The ruptured hose struck a Noble Assistant Driller on his left arm and an Oil States employee on the left side of his face. A Schlumberger Operator injured his knee while moving to avoid being struck. All three injuries were classified as First Aid Only. Laboratory analysis determined the hose failed due to chlorides corrosion coupled with rapid oxidation of wire reinforcement strands. The 3000 psi rated hose had only been in use for approximately 6 months and was pressurized to 2400 psi when it ruptured. Investigation found no safety restraints were installed on the manifold as recommended in Oil States Standard Operating Procedure, and there was no established hose inspection procedure or preventative maintenance program in place.",

      "summary": "On 16 July 2025 at 1810 hours, an external walkway platform on the third floor of a Temporary Living Quarters (TLQ) at Devils Tower SPAR platform unexpectedly detached from the TLQ structure by 12-18 inches while three Nabors employees were standing on it. The walkway remained held by stanchions and stairway connections. Investigation revealed inadequate welded tabs that lacked sufficient surface area for long-term support, combined with 23 years of marine corrosion and fatigue. The TLQ was originally designed as temporary housing in 2002 but remained in service. Visual-only inspections failed to detect weld deterioration. No injuries or dropped objects occurred due to immediate securing actions.",

      "summary": "On July 12, 2025, at approximately 3:30 p.m., a casing lifting pin failed during well abandonment operations on the VR-38M platform. The 2-inch diameter lifting pin bent into a U-shape under excessive load and struck a Supreme Services employee in the face, causing severe injuries including subdural hematoma, skull fracture, and facial bone fractures. The incident occurred when the crane operator attempted to lift stuck 7-inch casing using the main hoist. Investigation revealed the casing became stuck because a spool riser with 11.00-inch inside diameter was installed over a seal ring with 11.44-inch outside diameter. The lifting pin failed at an estimated load exceeding 102,000 pounds, well above its 60,000-pound safe working load limit. Contributing factors included improper sling installation with D-rings not adjacent to the casing, exceeding the approved lift plan's maximum weight capacity of 24,255 pounds, and failure to call an all-stop when the casing became stuck.",

      "summary": "On April 28, 2025, a nitrogen bottle exploded on the BW Pioneer FPSO during refilling operations. The bottle, rated for 2,400 psi, was mistakenly filled to over 5,000 psi because it was misidentified as a 6,000 psi bottle. The incorrect 9,000 psi relief valve installed during maintenance in December 2023 failed to prevent overpressurization. The explosion caused structural damage to the bottle rack, damaged nearby equipment including a diesel tank, and injured a crane operator with shrapnel, causing hearing impairment and minor bruises.",

      "summary": "On February 7, 2024, at approximately 09:30 am, a Danos contractor sustained a lost time injury (broken leg and ankle) when an inadequately built scaffolding ladder shifted while he was climbing it on the third rung. The ladder had been placed out of service on January 1, 2024, when the Self-Retracting Lanyard and scaffold tag were removed, but no visual identifiers marked it as OOS. The ladder had only two attachment points and was improperly constructed. The injured person jumped to the deck when the ladder shifted, sustaining injuries to both lower legs. Multiple systemic failures contributed including inadequate communication between operators and contractors, lack of bridging documents, no operator involvement in JSA processes, improper equipment inspection and maintenance, and inadequate fall protection equipment.",

While checking the tension on an air handling unit (AHU) belt in the Mud Module Electrical Room, he placed his left hand on a moving belt without proper lockout/tagout isolation. His hand was drawn between the belt and pulley, resulting in partial amputation of the left hand middle and ring fingertips. The engineer had shut off power but did not perform full energy isolation, worked without supervision, and did not communicate his task change to his supervisor. He was evacuated and treated for amputation of distal ends of middle and ring fingers with open non-displaced fractures.",

      "summary": "On 15 November 2024 at 0837 hours, a gas release occurred in the shaker house onboard the Valaris DS-16 drillship during well abandonment operations at Garden Banks 668. While attempting to bullhead well SS011, a hydrate plug formed in the production tubing. The crew displaced the landing string and kill line with nitrogen to dissipate the hydrate, then attempted to displace back to 12.2 ppg CaBr2. During this displacement, the liquid leg of the mud gas separator was compromised, allowing hydrocarbon gas to bypass the separator and enter the shaker house, triggering a hydrocarbon alarm and requiring full crew muster. Gas levels returned to zero and operations resumed without further issues.",

        "Conduct safety meetings with all four crews expressing the importance of circulating fluids/gases from well and how it could impact the mud gas separator liquid leg",

The drillship began drifting off location, requiring activation of the Emergency Disconnect System (EDS). This resulted in discharge of 513 barrels of calcium bromide into Gulf of Mexico waters. Two thrusters (#4 and #6) were operating at reduced power during the event for unknown reasons. No injuries, muster, or equipment damage occurred. The EDS performed as intended.",

The injured party attempted to jump across a four-foot gap with a one-foot eight-inch rise in elevation from the Coil Tubing Control Cabin to the Coil Tubing Reel Platform to install a Universal Tubing Length Monitor. During the transition, the IP lost his footing and started to fall. He grabbed the Coil Tubing Cabin crash frame with his left hand, injuring his left shoulder. The IP was wearing fall protection harness with self-retracting lanyard. Investigation determined the IP failed to follow the Job Safety Analysis which required use of a ladder for access.",

      "summary": "On February 17, 2025, an Expro Americas Inc. employee was using a man rider on the Noble Globetrotter 1 drillship to access the Coil Tubing Lift Frame at approximately 100 feet to tighten a leaking hydraulic hose. After completing the task, the man rider began descending at an accelerated uncontrolled rate. The hoist operator attempted to stop the descent by moving controls to hoist position and reaching for the emergency stop, but the employee reached the rig floor before the stop could be activated. Investigation revealed the OEM Programming and Control Logic had been altered from Default to Warning settings, bypassing critical safety systems including slack line detection, travel limits, and encoder performance monitoring. This prevented the load brakes from engaging. Environmental degradation of the drive motor and encoder, inadequate preventive maintenance, and insufficient third-party inspections were contributing factors. The employee was medically cleared for full duty.",

      "summary": "On December 25, 2024, a 340 lbs steel plate fell from a defective magnetic heavy lifting device on the Noble Drillship Blackhornet, striking two workers on their left feet. The welder (IP1) and roustabout (IP2) were lowering the plate when it prematurely disengaged from the magnetic lifting device, falling 47 inches. Both workers suffered swelling and contusions and were evacuated to hospital. Investigation revealed the magnetic lifting device had damaged pole shoes creating air gaps that reduced lifting capacity. Contributing factors included inadequate JSA, failure to conduct timeout for safety, employee perceived haste, and inadequate hazard identification.",

      "summary": "On May 8, 2025, two Transocean engineers were transferring nine sections of Hawse piping to a storage rack on the Deepwater Invictus drillship. After placing the eighth pipe section on the top tier, the 2nd Engineer left to retrieve a U-bolt while the 3rd Engineer began rigging the next pipe. The unsecured pipe section rolled off the rack, fell approximately 3 feet, and crushed the 3rd Engineer's right middle finger, resulting in fingertip amputation at the DIP joint. The incident was caused by failure to secure the pipe before removing lifting equipment, inadequate hazard identification in the pre-job briefing, and flawed storage rack design.",

      "summary": "On 25 April 2025 at approximately 1330 hours, a Louisiana Safety Systems Valve Technician was replacing trim and seal in a control valve on a 6-inch gas line at GI 47 AP platform. While disassembling the valve, a sudden gas release occurred causing the valve bonnet flange assembly (approximately 50 pounds) to strike the technician in the chest and abdomen, knocking him backwards onto the scaffolding deck. The technician sustained an anterior rib fracture of the 8th left rib and a laceration behind his ear. Investigation revealed the gas line had approximately 143 psi pressure (SCADA data showed pressure drop from 143 psi to 15 psi in 20 seconds). The technician failed to obtain proper permits, did not follow manufacturer recommendations for valve disassembly, worked on unapproved scaffolding without fall protection, and the Person-in-Charge did not verify energy isolation before work commenced.",

The IP was overcome by fumes and found face down in fluids/sludge, not breathing with no pulse. Two supervisors entered without respirators to rescue the IP. CPR was administered for 20 minutes before the IP was revived. The incident resulted from multiple failures to follow the confined space entry plan including: no tri-gas monitoring, no hole watch, no rescue equipment setup, improper PPE, no entry permit, and inadequate training. The operator also failed to accurately report the severity of the incident to BSEE.",

      "summary": "On June 2, 2023, at 12:30 hours, during crane operations at High Island A 382 F facility, the crane boom contacted the boom stop when raised to too high an angle, causing damage to the boom heel section cords. The Crane Operator was focusing on booming up and holding the ball level when the load block swung into the crane boom. The High Angle Kick Out limit switch failed to stop the boom from booming up too far. The incident resulted in $50,000 in estimated replacement costs with no injuries or pollution. The investigation concluded that Crane Operator inattentiveness of the boom angle was the primary cause, with the failure of the high angle kick out safety system as a contributing factor.",

      "summary": "On May 9, 2025, at approximately 1530 hours, a water hammer event occurred in the firewater system piping at the Horn Mountain SPAR platform in Mississippi Canyon Block 127. The incident began when an EnerMech technician accidentally initiated an ESD while troubleshooting an air compressor by turning the Bypass Rig Air switch, causing the TSE system to lose pressure. Following the ESD, multiple procedural failures and equipment issues occurred: the jockey water pump failed to automatically restart due to breaker issues, the T-gen ran out of fuel because SDV 2082 was not opened, and a suspected leaking check valve allowed the firewater main pressure to drop. When the main fire water pumps were restarted without first bleeding air from the system through helideck hose reels, a water hammer effect ruptured the FiberBond piping in multiple locations. A 1.5-pound metal support clamp broke loose and fell 30 feet, landing 5-6 feet from a worker near Lifeboat 4. The incident resulted in $250,000 in damage to the firewater system, including 3 failed gaskets, 2 piping joint leaks, 3 piping elbow leaks, 2 T-piping leaks, 3 piping spool leaks, and 1 wear at spool. No injuries occurred.",

      "summary": "On 21 October 2023 at 13:04 hours, platform personnel at Horn Mountain SPAR attempted to lift an 8,300-pound hydraulic chain jack cylinder using the West Crane. When the lift reached 15 feet above deck, two nylon choker slings failed due to contact with sharp edges on the cylinder, causing the load to fall onto two cargo baskets. The lifting authorities had decided not to use the manufacturer-recommended lifting pad-eyes, believing them to be frozen after 22 years in service. Instead, they used nylon choker slings wrapped around the cylinder body. The shorter slings used for this lift were positioned where they contacted sharp edges at the top of the jack, causing them to cut and fail. No personnel injuries occurred, and damage was limited to two cargo baskets. The incident could have been prevented by using the dedicated lifting pad-eyes as recommended by the manufacturer.",

      "summary": "On March 28, 2025, an able body seaman (AB1) aboard the Noble Stanley Lafosse drillship mistakenly operated emergency fuel shut off valve switches instead of accommodation fire dampener switches during routine preventative maintenance. This error caused all diesel generators to trip sequentially, resulting in a total blackout and loss of dynamic positioning. The drillship drifted off station, triggering a manual Emergency Disconnect Sequence that sheared the drill pipe and released 2,436 barrels of drilling brine into the Gulf of America. The incident caused $2.6 million in damage to subsea equipment. Contributing factors included failure to conduct a required Task Risk Assessment, AB1 working alone without adequate supervision, self-perceived time pressure, and lack of physical barriers protecting critical emergency fuel shut off valves.",

      "summary": "On May 29, 2025, at approximately 10:46 a.m., the Noble Stanley Lafosse Drillship experienced an unexpected change in wind speed and direction due to strong thunderstorms while preparing for cementing operations at Mississippi Canyon Block 300. Wind gusts reached 60 knots with waterspouts impacting the vessel, causing a 14-meter excursion while hanging off 5-7/8 inch drill pipe. The crew initiated an Emergency Disconnect Sequence, successfully closing blind shear rams and securing the well. The incident resulted in the discharge of 417 barrels of 10.9 ppg calcium chloride brine to the sea. No injuries were reported.",

      "summary": "On March 5, 2024, at 04:15 hrs, the Transocean Deepwater Poseidon drillship experienced extreme unexpected changes in wind speed and direction due to strong thunderstorms while drilling the AW003 well in Mississippi Canyon Block 391. Wind speeds rapidly increased from 30 kts to 83 kts with multiple directional shifts (South to West to North), causing vessel excursion beyond the red watch circle limit of 90.3 ft. An Emergency Disconnect Sequence was initiated, resulting in release of approximately 2,875 bbls of synthetic based mud to the seafloor. During the EDS event, three joints of 6-5/8 in pipe and an MPD bearing (total weight ~13,200 lbs) fell from the derrick onto the driller's shack, causing structural damage. This falling pipe incident was not initially disclosed to BSEE and was only discovered during a subsequent inspection on June 24, 2024.",

This led to faulty level readings, liquid carryover in vessels, and discharge of approximately 89 barrels of oil into Gulf of America waters over a 7-day period (08-15 February 2025). The discharge exceeded the daily maximum limit of 42 mg/l. BP personnel did not immediately realize the oil discharge was occurring. Once identified, the chemical trial was stopped and the original emulsion breaker formula was reinstated, successfully ending the sheening.",

The fire was caused by failure of a 90° elbow on the oil separator piping, which sprayed oil onto hot surfaces within the air compressor enclosure, igniting the oil. The platform's ESD system activated, shutting in the facility. The fire was extinguished by the Lead Operator and Fire Team using water monitors, deluge system, and hose reels. The CO2 fire suppression system in the adjacent generator enclosure activated as designed. No injuries, environmental impact, or platform damage occurred. The rental air compressor sustained fire damage and was removed for repairs costing $31,969.09.",

The cable roller had major corrosion identified during the October 2022 annual crane inspection with recommendations to repair or replace within 1-3 months, but the repairs were never completed. No barricades were installed to prevent personnel from entering the drop zone beneath the crane during repositioning operations. No injuries occurred, but the incident had potential for serious injury or fatality.",

The hydraulic brake did not release, causing the riser flange to be pulled out of the cart shuttle. The Cameron Hydraulic Riser Running Tool (HRRT) removable shank mandrel parted under shock load, and the riser joint fell back onto the riser cart, damaging the skate tailing arms, skate lift bucket, HRRT, and riser joint floatation. No injuries occurred. Estimated damage: $418,000.",

      "summary": "On June 5, 2024, at approximately 15:38 hours, a nitrogen cylinder ruptured inside a twelve-cylinder bottle rack onboard the Helix Q5000 during workover operations. The rupture was caused by severe corrosion that reduced wall thickness from 0.25 inches to 0.075 inches at the bottom of the bottle, which contained approximately 2,400 psi. The rupture damaged other cylinders in the rack and scattered them across the main deck. Three personnel staging equipment nearby sustained minor injuries from shrapnel. The incident resulted in $29,000 in damage to 2 nitrogen racks and an umbilical. Investigation revealed inadequate corrosion protection from water-based paint coating, insufficient inspection protocols that did not include disassembly for thorough examination, poor rack design allowing metal-to-metal contact, and lack of drainage causing prolonged exposure to corrosive marine environment.",

When the combination wrench being used was determined to be too long to access the fitting, the IP decided to modify the wrench by cutting it shorter with a manual hack saw. The wrench was placed in a vise, and as the IP cut through the final section, his weight shifted causing his hand to come down onto the freshly cut sharp edge, resulting in a laceration between the ring and little finger. The IP was treated onsite, then evacuated for sutures at an onshore medical facility. Investigation found inadequate pre-job planning, lack of supervision, and failure to obtain proper tools as probable causes.",

      "summary": "On January 6, 2023, at 13:00 hours, Shell Offshore Inc. experienced a pollution event at Mississippi Canyon 943 subsea well PN003-ST2-BP1, which is tied back to MC 807 B (Olympus). While attempting to open the Surface-Controlled Subsurface Safety Valve (SCSSV), there was an inability to build pressure in the SCSSV control lines and abnormal pressure behavior at the tubing and A-annulus head. An underwater ROV confirmed liquid being released to the environment through the High Pressure vent on the tree due to SCSSV control lines loss of integrity. The fluid mixture consisted of hydraulic fluid, methanol, calcium bromide completion brine, and synthetic based oil. Initial estimate was 9.26 gallons, later updated to 16.61 barrels total. The ROV closed control valves SV1 and SV2, stopping the leak. The well remains shut in with 2 barriers and pressure is being continuously monitored. The tubing is suspected to be parted at a shallow depth along with the SCSSV control lines, allowing a leak path from the wellbore to the SCSSV control lines to the HP vent.",

      "summary": "On 23 February 2025 at approximately 0830 hours at Mississippi Canyon 809 Platform A (Ursa), a SafeZone worker slipped backwards while securing felt and cleaning inside a Pressurized Welding Enclosure. The worker's right leg contacted a jagged edge of an I-beam, resulting in a 3-to-4-inch laceration. The worker fell 12-18 inches from an upper to lower level, insufficient to deploy fall protection equipment. The worker was medically evacuated and received 11 staples and 4 stitches. Investigation found inadequate hazard identification during pre-job assessment, lack of supervision, and failure to identify jagged edges and uneven surfaces in the JSA.",

      "summary": "On March 21, 2023, at approximately 16:45 hours, a rigger was injured during crane operations on the H&P 204 platform rig at Mississippi Canyon 809. The crew was staging a wireline riser (approximately 19 feet in length) with a red gate valve assembly into a transfer basket on the plus 50 level. During a blind lift using radio communication, as the upper end of the assembly was lowered, the lower end shifted and caught the rigger between the pipe and an adjacent basket. The rigger sustained a nondisplaced L4 fracture, traumatic hernia, and pelvic muscle tear. The incident occurred because the Designated Signal Person and rigging crew did not identify the pinch point hazard and the rigger positioned himself in a pinch point location between baskets in a congested workspace.",

      "summary": "On February 13, 2024, at approximately 22:35 hours on the Transocean Deepwater Proteus drillship at Mississippi Canyon 899, two Tetra filtration crew members were injured when a 6-inch camlock hose connection released under pressure during a leak repair. The crew was flushing deck penetration lines for completion operations. After flushing was completed, a Tetra employee attempted to repair a small leak by releasing the camlock connection levers. Trapped pressure in the line caused the hose to blow off, striking one worker in the face (fractured tooth) and knocking another worker into a pipe (thigh bruising and chemical exposure). Investigation found that the deck valve was closed immediately after pumping stopped, trapping pressure in the line. Proper PPE was not worn, whip checks were not positioned around the camlock connection, and lines were not properly drained before disconnection.",

      "summary": "On 10 May 2023 at approximately 0930 hours, two Grand Isle Shipyard workers were removing bolts from a flange on a 2-inch Well Equalization Header line during a scheduled shut-in at MC 941 Platform A (Titan spar). When loosening the last bolt, trapped pressure from residual fluids in a dog leg bend above the flange was released, spraying both workers in the face with hydrocarbon fluid. A nearby gas detector activated at 0933 hours, triggering platform alarm and muster. No injuries, pollution, or equipment damage occurred. Workers were wearing safety glasses and face shields which prevented injury. Investigation found that the possibility of residual fluids/trapped pressure in the dog leg bend was overlooked despite completion of Simple Isolation Certificate and zero pressure indication on gauge.",

      "summary": "On 15 June 2023, during a scheduled ABS UWILD inspection at the Titan SPAR platform (MC 941 A), abnormal slack was observed on Mooring Line #9 with a significant length resting on the seabed. The H-link connector was found buried at the seabed. Investigation revealed the 5-inch Grade RQ4 chain link had parted. Metallurgical analysis concluded the failure was most likely due to fatigue initiating at the top of the crown where stresses are high, with corrosion as a contributing factor. Historical data showed ML #9 tension had decreased significantly in March 2022, with low tension alarms noted in September 2022. The remaining 3 mooring lines on the Port Column were inspected and found in good condition, allowing continued manned operations.",

      "summary": "On 03 May 2025 at 0830 hours, during a blind lift operation to install an Electric Submersible Fire Water Pump (ESFWP) into a caisson below the top deck, a flange attached to Fiberbond pipe contacted an I-Beam. This contact caused the piping to separate at the flange, resulting in the ESFWP and 25 feet of attached pipe falling 4 feet to the deck below. The incident caused minor damage to deck grating, Fiberbond pipe, and the ESFWP valued at $1,792. No injuries or pollution occurred. The incident was attributed to inadequate hazard identification, failure to use tag lines, and poor communication with multiple personnel giving conflicting instructions to the crane operator during the blind lift.",

As the IP cleared the obstruction, heated Triethylene Glycol (350°F) drained out of the bridle and splashed onto the IP, resulting in severe 2nd degree burns to approximately 27% of the body (abdomen, arms, and side). The IP was wearing PPE adequate for ambient temperature liquids but not suitable for 350°F glycol. The IP followed proper testing procedures, but the JSA overlooked the thermal hazard of hot glycol splash.",

      "summary": "On March 12, 2023, at 1633 hours, two Louisiana Safety Systems (LSS) technicians were injured on MP 311 B platform while working on well QAY B-18ST's production casing valves. A 1-inch stainless steel gas lift injection tubing rated at approximately 3100 psi ruptured due to 4330 psi of unexpected trapped pressure. One technician (IP #1) was knocked off a 4-foot aluminum stand and sustained serious injuries requiring helicopter evacuation. The second technician (IP #2) was knocked backwards by the force of escaping gas. The incident resulted from multiple failures: operators failed to monitor casing pressure, failed to perform required casing diagnostics, the facility was not built to approved drawings with tubing under-rated for actual pressures, and no pre-job hazard walkthrough was conducted. Workers were unaware of the 4330 psi pressure on the casing, believing it to be zero based on inaccurate SCADA readings from an isolated sensing line.",

One corroded nitrogen bottle ruptured, causing a chain reaction that compromised the aluminum rack and sent bottles flying across the platform. Four bottles went overboard into the Gulf, seven were scattered on deck, and one remained in the damaged rack. No personnel were injured despite being in the vicinity. The bottles were daisy-chained together with 1/4 inch stainless steel tubing, which caused the cascade failure. Investigation revealed the bottles were at least 1 year overdue for inspection.",

      "summary": "On January 16, 2024, at approximately 0252 hours, the C1 compressor experienced a piston failure at Arena Offshore SM 128 B Facility. The piston rod penetrated the housing, releasing gas that ignited. The night operator discovered the fire, activated the fire alarm and ESD, and alerted personnel. Operators extinguished the fire using a firewater hose and dry chemical extinguishers. Investigation revealed the piston detached from the piston rod due to a loosened nut, causing connecting rod bolts to break and the piston rod to contact the cylinder head. The vibration switch tripped but failed to shut down the compressor due to frozen moisture in the output line caused by 17°F temperatures. No injuries occurred. The compressor is scheduled for rebuild.",

Sparks from cutting operations ignited hydrocarbon vapors venting from the thief hatch. Fire-retardant blankets failed to provide adequate protection. The fire was extinguished with no damage to equipment or injuries to personnel. Investigation revealed multiple failures including inadequate gas monitoring, improper lockout/tagout procedures, insufficient fire protection barriers, and failure to implement previously identified mitigations.",

      "summary": "On December 15, 2023, at approximately 0520 hours, an explosion and fire occurred on the Talos ERT LLC OCS-G02280, South Marsh Island 130 B Facility. A 3-foot section of an 8-inch bi-directional gas pipeline (Segment 5114) containing 1220 psi failed due to severe external corrosion of a flange. The resulting fire reached approximately 80 feet high from below the +10 level to the production deck. The flame lasted 5-7 minutes before gas pressure bled down. There was damage to life saving equipment, wiring, and minor structural damage near the +10 level. No injuries occurred. High winds (28 mph) blew the flame away from the platform, potentially preventing more severe damage. Investigation revealed the flange failed due to severe OD corrosion driven by high chlorine concentrations (12,000 ppm) in an oxygen-containing environment, with inadequate coating maintenance and incomplete mechanical integrity inspections.",

      "summary": "On 9 September 2023, during well abandonment operations on Well C-28 at Apache Corporation's SM Block 281C platform, the 13.375-inch casing on adjacent Well C-11 dropped approximately 3 feet due to severe corrosion failure. The drop sheared off the valve for the 13.375-inch casing completely and partially sheared the valve for the 9.625-inch production casing, releasing 704 psi of gas lift pressure into the atmosphere. The incident was caused by complete loss of the 26-inch conductor casing due to corrosion, which exposed the 13.375-inch surface casing to severe corrosion, ultimately causing it to collapse. Platform grating and decking around Well C-11 were damaged. No injuries or pollution were reported. Apache failed to immediately notify BSEE as required by regulations.",

      "summary": "On February 25, 2024, at approximately 0930 hours, a crane boom was damaged while attempting to raise the elevation of an I-beam approximately 1-inch on the Talos ERT LLC SM 130 B Facility. After unsuccessful attempts with come along winches, the contract construction crew attached the main line of the crane to the I-beam and applied tension up to 30,000 lbs. The crane boom was damaged at the heel section and a boom lattice after the load rating was exceeded. The crane was at a 55-degree angle with a maximum capacity of 21,500 lbs. There were no injuries and estimated repair cost is $400,000.",

      "summary": "On May 12, 2023, at approximately 1605 hours, a crane boom collapse occurred on the Talos ERT LLC OCS-G02280 South Marsh Island 130 B Facility. While attempting to lower a basket of grating weighing approximately 11,000 lbs to the top deck using a four-part load line, the boom cable failed when the grating rack was approximately 6 ft from the top deck and the boom angle was at 76 degrees. The boom collapsed and landed on the top deck, causing approximately $330,000 in damage to the deck and production equipment and $370,000 in crane damage. There were no injuries to personnel. Analysis by Core Lifting determined the boom cable failed due to fatigue from numerous cycles through the bridle sheaves, evidenced by numerous short pieces of wire embedded in the cable with fatigue fractures at both ends. The crane had accumulated 124 hours of run time since the boom cable was installed on May 28, 2021.",

Gas and oil were escaping through a hole in the side of the casing, creating a hydrocarbon sheen in Gulf waters. Despite immediately shutting in the well and closing the SCSSV, hydrocarbons continued to escape. Multiple intervention attempts were made over 8 days before a bridge plug was successfully set on 29 September, with the leak stopping on 30 September at 0132 hours. Total spill was estimated at 65.7 gallons of oil. The incident was attributed to equipment failure due to inadequate preventive maintenance and severe corrosion in an extremely harsh shallow saltwater environment.",

      "summary": "On July 30, 2025, during plug and abandonment operations on Well C005 at the South Pass 49 C platform, a Supreme Services crew was laying down a 12-inch mechanical casing cutter into a shipping basket. While guiding the tool, the outermost slip bowl (approximately 250 pounds) unexpectedly separated due to grease lock and slid down the tool. A Supreme operator's left hand was caught between the bowl and tool, resulting in traumatic amputation of one finger and crush injuries to two others, which were later permanently amputated. Investigation revealed that the operator's no hands policy was not effectively communicated or enforced, hands-free tools were not provided, no task-specific risk assessment was conducted, and the hazard of bowl separation was not identified.",

Platform operators confirmed the gas release using a portable gas detector. The gas was leaking from the corroded pipe and blowing under the wet and dry oil tanks. The platform was manually shut in. The gas release was not detected by the platform safety system and did not initiate any alarms. The corroded section of piping had not been identified by API Level 1 surveys or platform operators. No injuries or pollution occurred. The platform remained shut in until repairs were completed on 09 November 2025.",

The lever arm assembly that assists in positioning the cap had become damaged during removal, forcing the crew to manually lift the cap. The crew mistakenly believed the cap was securely threaded and lessened their hold, causing it to fall. The sharp edge of the lever arm shaft penetrated the injured person's cut-resistant gloves, causing a laceration to the right hand. The IP was evacuated by helicopter and treated with eleven sutures at an onshore medical facility.",

      "summary": "On January 31, 2023, during temporary abandonment operations of the E-4 well at Ship Shoal 224 E platform, an electric line casing cutter was fired at 120 feet below mud line. Trapped pressure in the annulus between the 10-3/4 inch and 7-5/8 inch casing was released when the casing was cut below the subsea wellhead tieback system. The pressure release ejected the tool string from the well, damaging grating on the cellar and wellbay decks. No injuries occurred. The crew was unaware that the well did not communicate above or below the subsea tieback system, and no wireline pressure control equipment was used because the surface wellhead had been removed in 2007.",

      "summary": "On March 7, 2025, at 0815 hours, a flash fire occurred at W&T Offshore's Ship Shoal Block 80 Platform A while attempting to bring Pipeline Pump #2 online. When the electrician opened the start valve to supply fuel gas to the pump's starter, a backfire occurred followed by a flash fire. Investigation revealed an extremely loose fitting on the vent exhaust piping from the fuel gas starter allowed gas to seep out and accumulate. The backfire ignited the accumulated gas, causing a flash fire that injured a mechanic and electrician with burns to their heads and hands. Neither worker was wearing proper PPE (gloves). Wind conditions (25-30 knots from the south) pushed flames into the mechanic positioned on the northern side of the pump, causing more severe injuries. Both were evacuated and treated at burn unit, with the electrician returning to work April 9, 2025.",

      "summary": "On May 9, 2025, during crane operations to lower a JSA document to a supply vessel at platform ST-229A, a sheave bearing failure in the crane load block caused a catastrophic mechanical failure. An internal debris restriction in the sheave pin's lubrication passage prevented adequate grease from reaching the bearings. One bearing failed, generating excessive rotational force that sheared the anti-rotation dowel pin. This allowed the sheave pin and spiral retainers to rotate freely, causing them to unwind and dislodge. The wire rope (135 ft, 78.3 lbs) fell onto the aft deck of the MV Force, followed by the load block (falling 65 ft, 1,235 lbs). The ejected sheave (32 lbs) was slung upward approximately 100 feet before landing on a grocery box on the vessel deck. A deckhand, standing approximately 20 feet away, sustained a lumbar muscle strain while evading the falling components. All three objects possessed fatal potential energy. The incident was classified as a near-miss and first aid case. The IP was released to full duty but did not return to work. Root cause analysis confirmed inadequate lubrication due to internal obstruction. Contributing factors included failure to follow safe work practice of lowering loads to minimum safe height before swinging over vessels, and inadequate operator awareness of early mechanical distress indicators.",

      "summary": "On January 29, 2024 at approximately 1745, a fire occurred on the Glycol Reboiler vent line at Cantium LLC facility South Timbalier Block 23 CC. The facility had shut in due to a Level Safety Low on the Glycol Surge Tank. While operators were pumping glycol into the Surge Vessel, a flame was noticed coming from the Pressure Safety Valve vent line for the Glycol Reboiler when the valve relieved pressure. The fire was extinguished using potable water. Investigation revealed that the packing section was not reinstalled properly in the still column after maintenance in October 2023. Without the packing section, the ability to preheat glycol was removed, allowing entrained gases to be released into the Reboiler, causing the PSV to relieve and ignite.",

A junior propane service technician was transferring liquid propane from an existing tank to a newly installed tank when he removed a plug from the existing tank's liquid withdrawal valve, causing liquid propane to spray out. A large vapor cloud formed and expanded into the store. The technician called his supervisor and then 911, but minutes after emergency responders arrived, the explosion occurred. The explosion leveled the store, destroyed a responding ambulance, and damaged nearby vehicles.",

Later that day, a phosgene release from a burst hose exposed a worker who died the following evening. Investigation found common deficiencies in multiple safety management systems and identified that the PTFE-lined braided stainless steel hose was susceptible to phosgene permeability and corrosion.",

The event was triggered when a raffinate splitter tower was overfilled during startup. The overfilling caused pressure relief devices to open and dump flammable liquid into a blowdown drum fitted with a stack without a flare. The blowdown drum also overfilled, releasing flammable liquid out of the stack into the surrounding area where it evaporated as it fell to ground. Subsequent ignition of the flammable vapors led to the explosions and fire.",

All victims were 25 years or younger. The CSB investigation identified 26 similar incidents between 1983 and 2010 resulting in 44 fatalities and 25 injuries. All incidents involved rural unmanned sites lacking fencing and hazard signage. The CSB found that existing API standards did not adequately address security measures for upstream exploration and production facilities to prevent unauthorized public access.",

      "summary": "On July 20, 2003, chlorine gas was released from Honeywell's refrigerant manufacturing plant in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, resulting in hospitalization of four workers and requiring nearby residents to shelter in place. Chlorine entered the control room through the HVAC system, forcing employee evacuation before the leak could be stopped, and corroded the process control system rendering it inoperable. Two subsequent incidents occurred: on July 29, 2003, a worker was fatally injured by antimony pentachloride exposure from a gas cylinder release, and on August 13, 2003, two workers were exposed to hydrofluoric acid with one hospitalized. The CSB investigation identified lacking guidance and standards for positive pressure control room design and maintenance in the U.S. chemical industry.",

      "summary": "On November 9, 2010, one contract worker was killed and another was injured in an explosion at the DuPont Yerkes facility in Buffalo, New York. Contractors were welding atop a 10,000 gallon slurry tank when hot sparks ignited flammable vinyl fluoride vapor that had accumulated inside the tank, triggering an explosion. The investigation found multiple deficiencies in the hot work permitting process, including incomplete permits, lack of hazard verification, failure to isolate the tank from adjacent in-service tanks via an overflow line, and absence of atmospheric testing for flammable vapor.",

        "R1: Develop and enforce corporate-directed policies and procedures requiring all DuPont facilities to audit hot work permitting systems to ensure explosion hazards are identified and mitigated, all forms are completed per corporate policies and industry standards (NFPA 326 and NFPA 51B), and appropriate personnel approve permits",
        "R2: Revise corporate policies to require positive isolation of all process piping or connections to tanks/vessels using closed valves, blind flanges or pancake blanks, and appropriate venting before authorizing hot work",
        "R3: Revise corporate policies to require atmosphere monitoring inside containers for flammable vapor prior to performing welding, cutting, or grinding on container surfaces",
        "R4: Revise corporate policies to require air monitoring for flammable vapor inside containers for the duration of hot work consistent with industry standards (NFPA 326, NFPA 51B), and create policy for determining criteria for continuous or periodic testing"

      "summary": "On October 23, 2009, while offloading gasoline from the tanker ship Cape Bruny into the CAPECO onshore tank farm, approximately 200,000 gallons of gasoline overflowed from an aboveground storage tank into a secondary containment dike with an open drain. Gasoline sprayed from the tank's roof vents, aerosolized, and formed a large vapor cloud covering approximately 107 acres. The vapor cloud ignited at the wastewater treatment facility, causing a blast that registered 2.9 on the Richter scale, multiple secondary explosions, and fires that burned for almost 60 hours. The incident resulted in significant damage to 17 of 48 petroleum storage tanks, approximately 300 homes and businesses up to 1.25 miles away, three minor injuries offsite, and petroleum contamination of soil, wetlands, and waterways.",

      "summary": "On June 27, 2016, a major loss of containment resulted in the release of methane, ethane, propane, and several other hydrocarbons at the Enterprise Products Pascagoula Gas Plant in Pascagoula, Mississippi. The hydrocarbons ignited, initiating a series of fires and explosions, which ultimately shut down the site for almost six months. Two workers were on the night shift when the incident occurred and were uninjured. The CSB determined that the probable cause of this incident was the failure of a brazed aluminum heat exchanger (BAHX) due to thermal fatigue. The absence of a reliable process to ensure the mechanical integrity of the heat exchanger contributed to the catastrophic failure of the equipment.",

The fire burned for three days, spreading to all fifteen tanks in the containment area, destroying them all. On March 22, 2019, the containment wall partially collapsed, releasing approximately 500,000 barrels (21 million gallons) of petroleum products, firefighting foam, and water into Tucker Bayou and the Houston Ship Channel. No injuries occurred.",

      "summary": "On April 20, 2010, a blowout occurred at the Macondo oil well approximately 50 miles off the coast of Louisiana during temporary well-abandonment activities on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig. Control of the well was lost, resulting in uncontrolled release of oil and gas. The hydrocarbons found an ignition source on the rig, resulting in explosions and fire that led to 11 deaths, 17 serious physical injuries, evacuation of 115 individuals, sinking of the Deepwater Horizon, and massive marine and coastal damage from approximately 4 million barrels of released hydrocarbons.",

The bottom head failed due to oxygen pitting corrosion and generalized corrosion that thinned the vessel wall. The explosion fatally injured one Loy-Lange employee and the launched vessel crashed through a nearby building roof, killing three members of the public. The incident resulted from deficiencies in operations and process safety practices that failed to prevent corrosion, an inadequate 2012 repair by Kickham Boiler that left damaged material in place, and acceptance of the non-conforming repair by Arise Inc.'s inspector.",

Workers were conducting a 'gas blow' whereby natural gas was forced through piping at high volume and pressure to remove debris. The natural gas and debris were vented into a congested outdoor area where the natural gas accumulated and found an ignition source, resulting in an explosion. The explosion resulted in six fatalities and injured at least 50 other personnel.",

Rainwater contacted the exposed TCCA, initiating a chemical reaction and decomposition. The resulting heat started a fire and released a large plume of hazardous gases including toxic chlorine over the nearby community. No injuries were reported. The facility underwent approximately $250 million in redesign and reconstruction before resuming operations in March 2023.",

Two workers sustained fatal injuries after hot gases and debris blown from the furnace broke through the double-pane reinforced glass window of the control room, which was located only 12 feet from the furnace. A third worker also sustained injuries. The investigation found that furnace overpressure events occurred a few times a year but were not investigated for root cause. Water leaks into the furnace could contribute to overpressure events, but Carbide did not have a robust inspection and mechanical integrity program. The close proximity of the control room to the furnace was not addressed despite previous overpressure events breaking control room windows.",

      "summary": "On January 28, 2021, liquid nitrogen overflowed from an immersion freezer at Foundation Food Group facility in Gainesville, GA while two maintenance employees were troubleshooting the equipment. The liquid nitrogen quickly vaporized and created an oxygen deficient atmosphere. Two maintenance employees were fatally injured. During rescue attempts, four additional employees were fatally injured and three more employees plus one firefighter were seriously injured from oxygen deprivation. The incident resulted in an estimated $1.95 million in damage.",

      "summary": "On May 31, 2017, an explosion and fire occurred at the Didion Milling facility in Cambria, Wisconsin. The fire spread throughout the facility resulting in multiple combustible dust explosions both within and external to the production equipment. Five employees were fatally injured and 14 were injured. Fatalities and injuries were caused by exposure to flames from combustible dust explosions and flash fires, and building collapse. The incident resulted in an estimated $15.37 million in property damage. The CSB investigation found ineffective combustible dust safety management, ineffective process safety leadership, and lack of regulatory coverage for combustible dusts.",

The release resulted in the fatalities of four employees (three operators and a shift supervisor) inside the Lannate manufacturing building. All four victims died from a combination of asphyxia and acute exposure to toxic chemicals including methyl mercaptan. Three victims were located on the third floor and one was descending the stairs between the third and second floor.",

The facility blended and packaged motor oils, hydraulic oils, and other highly flammable liquids. Firefighters were unable to control the fire, which burned for 24 hours and consumed 1.2 million gallons of combustible and flammable liquids, destroying the entire site. The facility lacked fire detection equipment, was unstaffed at night, and had no water source for fire suppression. One hundred residents were evacuated and a local school was closed.",

      "summary": "On May 4, 2009, an explosion and fire occurred at the Veolia ES Technical Solutions LLC facility in West Carrollton, Ohio. Tetrahydrofuran (THF), a flammable organic solvent, was released from a solvent recovery process in a tank farm area. Uncontrolled venting of THF allowed flammable vapors to accumulate to explosive concentrations outside the process equipment. The gas subsequently ignited, likely from two natural gas-fired boilers in a lab/operations building located 30 feet away. The initial blast injured four workers, two seriously. Multiple subsequent explosions significantly damaged the site, and nearby residences and businesses also sustained considerable damage.",

      "summary": "On July 19, 2009, a hydrocarbon gas release occurred at the CITGO Corpus Christi East Refinery HF alkylation unit when violent shaking in process recycle piping broke two threaded connections. The shaking was caused by nearly complete flow blockage due to sudden failure of a control valve whose internal plug unthreaded from the valve stem. The hydrocarbon cloud ignited causing extensive damage and a multi-day fire. One employee was critically injured and another treated for possible HF exposure. The fire caused multiple failures releasing approximately 21 tons of HF, with the water mitigation system capturing most but an estimated 2-4 tons released to atmosphere. CITGO nearly exhausted its water supply during the incident, requiring emergency salt water pumping from the ship channel.",

The spill occurred during a diesel transfer operation when operators left the discharge hose in the containment skid during lunch break, causing a siphoning effect that overflowed the containment. Despite firefighting efforts by 6 POB using handheld and wheel unit extinguishers, the fire spread to the 8-man sleeper and grew beyond control. The PIC ordered evacuation at approximately 1320 hours. All personnel safely evacuated via M/V Landon James with no serious injuries. Two supply vessels extinguished the fire using water cannons. Estimated damage: $1.9 million.",

      "summary": "On November 24, 2024, at approximately 1710 hours, a 3/4 inch pipe nipple on the sight glass level bridle for Compressor #1 Suction Scrubber cracked and broke, causing a gas release at VK-915A (Marlin) Tension Leg Platform. The gas alarm activated, the Control Room Operator investigated and confirmed the release, and the Emergency Shutdown System shut in the platform. A platform muster was conducted with no injuries. The compressor and scrubber were isolated, the broken nipple was replaced within 30 minutes, and production resumed. Investigation determined the nipple failed due to fatigue cracking from multiple contributing factors including possible over-tightening during installation, vibration from the compressor, and excessive weight from the sight glass level bridle. The operator will submit a Management of Change to install additional support to prevent recurrence.",

      "summary": "On 04 May 2025 at 0445 hours, the 178-foot supply vessel M/V Adriatic struck the Marlin Tension Leg Platform (VK 915 A) operated by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation. The vessel's captain was preparing paperwork for a drift test and not focused on navigation. The second captain had been given permission to leave the bridge, leaving no one actively steering the vessel. The bow contacted the Northwest pontoon and the right stern contacted the Southwest pontoon, damaging two production risers (Dorado and Crown and Anchor), a gas lift line, and firewater piping. The platform was manually ESD'd and production was shut in. No injuries or pollution occurred. Estimated damage exceeded $10 million.",

The gas release was detected by control room operators during testing, confirmed by ROV investigation showing gas bubbles at a 90-degree bend in the flowline. The operator immediately suspended testing and isolated the pipeline segment. The suspected cause is corrosion at a previous field repair weld that may have had imperfections. Repair options include installing an engineered clamp or replacing the damaged section with flexible pipe.",

The wrench was improperly installed with only one back-up line instead of the two required by the manufacturer's user manual, allowing excessive rotational movement. The AD was diagnosed with a concussion and evacuated to shore two days after the incident. Investigation revealed the user manual was not readily available to rig personnel, and rig personnel were trained on the job without written procedures.",

      "summary": "On August 11, 2024, at approximately 7:10 p.m., an explosion and fires occurred on the deck of the liftboat Brazos at Vermilion Block 170 A during well cleanup and test operations. Two PTS workers were injured with second-degree burns. The incident was caused by gas escaping through improperly latched hatches on a 500-barrel atmospheric tank, creating a flammable atmosphere that was drawn into a rental diesel generator. The generator's faulty electronic control module prevented the automatic air intake shutdown device from functioning when the engine oversped, leading to ignition of the gas plume. Contributing factors included lack of written procedures, inadequate hazard analysis, poor maintenance of tank hatch O-rings, and calm wind conditions that allowed gas accumulation.",

      "summary": "On February 21, 2024, at approximately 1349 hours, a fire occurred at the HI A 379 B platform operated by W&T Offshore during construction operations to replace corroded deck plating. While a construction fitter was grinding freshly laid welds, sparks migrated through two layers of protective fire blanket barriers into a chemical/methanol storage area approximately six feet away, igniting flammable materials. The fire was extinguished using multiple fire extinguishers and hose reels. The facility was shut down via ESD. Investigation revealed that flammable materials should have been removed per JSA requirements rather than relying on fire blanket barriers.",

      "summary": "On August 10, 2023, at approximately 5:15 pm, during decommissioning operations at West Cameron 33 Platform, a 2.5-ton wire rope sling parted while lifting a water abrasive cutter from a 48-inch caisson. The abrasive cutter had hung up in the caisson and was being re-lifted when it hung up again simultaneously with a wave surge. The parted sling struck an Offshore Technical Services employee on the head and neck, causing a forehead laceration requiring 16 stitches and a C6 vertebrae fracture. The incident occurred in 5-7 foot seas with the injured person standing next to the open caisson without fall protection. The JSA did not address dynamic loading from adverse sea conditions or specify the maximum lift weight relative to sling capacity.",

      "summary": "On 27 August 2025 at 1045 hours, a crane boom cable separated during a dynamic lift of an 8,000-pound Power Pack from a motor vessel to the WD-152 A platform. The crane boom fell uncontrollably, striking platform handrails and the motor vessel stern. Investigation revealed a seized bearing in the boom cable bridle sheave assembly caused the sheave pin to wear down approximately 1/2 inch. The cable cut through the Nylatron sheave material until it contacted the hardened bearing race, then cut through the sheave side, ultimately failing under slow strain. A small amount of hydraulic fluid entered the Gulf of America from broken hoses and fittings. No injuries occurred. Damage totaled $125,000.",

The ESD was activated, shutting down the entire facility. All 26 personnel on board mustered upwind at the quarters structure and sheltered in place due to severe weather conditions (5-8 foot seas, 20-30 knot winds with gusts to 40 knots). The pipeline was bled down from 1080 psi to 0 psi. A light non-recoverable sheen (2.56 miles long, 300 feet wide) was observed during overflight. Investigation determined the leak was caused by inadequate preventative maintenance, with repairs identified in a 2015 Level 2 survey never completed, and inadequate inspection methods (drone survey on 15 Feb 2023 insufficient, no intelligent PIG inspection conducted).",

      "summary": "On April 21, 2025, at approximately 19:30hrs CDT, the West Delta 90 B platform experienced a loss of well control during Plug and Abandonment operations on well B020. While pumping fluid down the tubing to equalize pressure across a downhole plug, approximately 20 barrels of oil and gas were released from a leak at the starter head flange and 10-3/4 x 20 surface casing annulus. The uncontrolled release led to full platform evacuation. The incident resulted from a breach at the spooling head and failure within the tubing string that enabled hydraulic communication between tubing and annulus. Contributing factors included inadequate pre-job planning, failure to incorporate historical well data showing prior leakage issues, and lack of hazard assessment before continuing operations after initial leak detection.",

      "summary": "On November 16, 2022, at 05:11 AM, approximately twelve barrels of Synthetic Based Mud (SBM) were discharged into the Gulf of Mexico from the Diamond Offshore drillship West Vela during exploration drilling operations at 25,000 feet depth. A saltwater kick of fifty-eight barrels occurred below the base of salt, causing the Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) system Surface Back Pressure to exceed 1,300 psi, triggering Pressure Relief Valves that were lined up to discharge overboard instead of to the flowline. The well was successfully shut in with shut-in drill pipe pressure of 1,600 psi, and the kick was circulated out. The MPD system was not designed to control influxes greater than five barrels.",
      "recommendations": [
        "MPD procedures and hole section influx management envelope matrix should include a differential flow threshold to inform the Driller how to respond when using MPD",
        "When using PCVs for MPD, ensure modeling is performed to determine: 1) optimal PCV setpoints with down hole pumps on based on maximum kick intensity; 2) maximum PCV setpoint based on required SBP for connections with down hole pumps off",
        "Set maximum PCV pressure to protect against PRVs from opening based on a maximum flow rate for the selected setpoint",
        "Review FMCA for plugging downstream of the MPD choke to confirm the correct PRV set point should limit system to pressure rating of equipment upstream of the choke",
        "Review the latest version of the flow control software that responds to influxes in step changes and switches the MPD from Flow Control to SBP mode when the high-pressure limit is reached to allow the chokes to open before the PCV limit is reached"

The PLS only engaged the roller jaw while the centralizer and gripper arms did not fully grip due to a hydraulic leak.
